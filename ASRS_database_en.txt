While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative." He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed. Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat;
especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night,
the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs,
the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibililty and ILS not usable,
flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet,
assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing,
turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow decent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload
so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions,
where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew,
resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane,
but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart,
I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones
and their lights(several of them") were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute,
only to reappear again,
especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more i noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again,
close to their same locations they held prior,
and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear,
which I thought was very weird. When telling my neighbors,
they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident,
and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an *AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU* caution message was displayed,
and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft,
and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down,
I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate,
I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls
and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance,
we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely,
while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist
and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around. We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our decent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather,
terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate,
and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach,
when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport,
the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us
so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes,
noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat
and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone
so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine
and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged,
apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather,
I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water
where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time,
I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show,
immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part
that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones
especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated message.
Crew discontinued ILS approach,
[request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering,
some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles,
#2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs.
X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now),
which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC,
ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1,
and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector
so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed
they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time
including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures,
CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay
to troubleshoot the EICAS messages
and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing
since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication
On an IFR departure,
I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower,
I checked in with ATC with the tail number,
my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC. Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX,
my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude".
What I did hear was "verify your altitude".
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100,
which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before
and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back?
turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point,
direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls
and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P,
which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?".
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn,
I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction,
and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR,
which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply,
I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix
and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb,
which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event,
which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by:
1.
ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and,
enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude,
I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me
to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
2.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC For example:
Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
3.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss
and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit,
do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported mis-communication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC,
then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).

While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
While on a long final approach, my descent was too early and I came too close to an antenna on the final approach course.
If I had it to do over again, I would have filed IFR and shot the RNAV 6 into CDN.
This was a lesson to make better aeronautical decisions in the future.
I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.
After arriving, I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.
Eventually, I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.
Earlier that morning, I checked the METAR, TAF, and NOTAMs for the area.
The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.
The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain.
Launching from near the top, I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.
The first flight, which lasted approximately 35 minutes, went smoothly.
After a short rest, I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.
This time, I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area.
I initiated a slow, straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.
I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter.
I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.
I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.
Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS.
I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.
The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.
I flew into Aspen (ASE) and deviated from the published instrument approach procedure (LOC DME E).
I was told by the approach controller to expect vectors to Jargu, an IF on the approach.
I loaded the approach and, upon being given an initial vector, activated vectors to final on the FMS.
However, I noted that the Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs) for all but the Final Approach Fix (FAF) were not showing next to the fixes in the FMS.
I had my chart on my iPad, which I used to verify the MEAs.
I was given a last vector to join the LOC and was cleared for the approach with the restriction to cross Jargu at 13,000 ft.
I turned to my assigned vector using heading mode automation and hit the approach mode on standby.
The LOC was captured, and I was established on the approach at 13,000 ft.
My plan was to manually set the step-down altitudes and VS down to the subsequent fixes in the approach.
Once established, my FMS was indicating that my next fix was the FAF, DOYPE, which has an MEA of 11,700 ft.
I set my altitude bug to 11,700 ft and began my descent using VS.
In reality, I was crossing on the KICER to FIMSO leg which MEA is 12300.
At this point, I was still in IMC and had no reason to believe I was deviating from the procedure.
As I crossed approximately 12,300 ft and descending, I was asked by the approach controller if I had the field in sight.
I replied "negative."
He then gave me a minimum altitude alert and instructed me to climb immediately to 13,000 ft.
During the interaction, I had descended another 400 ft before arresting the descent and beginning to climb.
I was then cancelled of my approach clearance and vectored back around for another attempt.
I take full responsibility for the deviation.
In hindsight, I relied too heavily on the FMS and didn't adequately cross-check my position and altitude using DME.
I've flown into Aspen many times, which may have contributed to complacency on my part.
I relied too heavily on the FMS.
If I would've been prepared and crosschecked with DME to identify the fixes, the deviation would have not occurred.
I've scheduled instrument flight training to fly this particular approach procedure and figure out why the FMS was not sequencing the fixes.
This incident was a valuable learning experience.
I appreciate the approach controller's assistance during the second approach, by giving me position checks, which helped ensure a safe and successful landing.
The most important lesson is to be prepared to crosscheck with DME on all localizer approaches and not rely solely on FMS.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.
We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2.
We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5,000 feet.
I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice.
I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7,500 to limit our exposure to the ice.
Center gave us a block altitude and we complied.
Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice.
As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft, I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final.
The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up.
At points on the approach, I had VSI indications of around 2,000ft per minute.
I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately.
As we came out of the clouds, I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain.
I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway.
Once I had the runway in site, I pulled the power and dumped the flaps.
I possibly oversped the flaps as well.
I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway.
We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan.
After debriefing myself and the other instructor, we realize that we are very lucky to be alive.
We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility.
I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled.
I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.
Diverted from intended destination of SRQ due to low visibility.
Attempted LOC 14 approach in SRQ but the minimums were too high to break out of the fog.
Uneventful diversion with constant coordination between us, Dispatch, and Operations.
Report filed.
Before departure, I spoke with Dispatch multiple times.
During one of our conversations, they mentioned that they called SRQ to inquire about extending Tower hours for our arrival due to an inbound aircraft delay.
They denied the request.
I asked our new Dispatcher enroute to call SRQ again before they closed for a weather and condition update.
They did so and said there were no additional details relative to what we already had.
When we checked on with Tampa Approach, they informed us that the ILS was unusable because SRQ Tower was closed.
This is the first either us or Dispatch heard of the ILS being unusable when Tower is closed.
There were no NOTAMs we could find to indicate this.
Both of us were shocked that through two phone calls from two different dispatchers over the course of a few hours, no one mentioned this caveat, especially considering the extremely low visibility and ceilings.
Considering that per procedures we are forbidden from shooting the RNAV when the Tower is closed at night, the ILS was our only legitimate likely shot.
Air carrier Captain reported that although there were no applicable NOTAMs, the flight crew was informed by ATC that the ILS was unusable because Tower was closed.
Due to low visibility and ILS not usable, flight crew was required to divert.
On departure from ZZZ ceilings at 500 feet, assigned left turn to 050 while climbing to 2,000 feet.
Engaged auto pilot at 700 feet AGL.
Autopilot initiated the turn and continued the climb.
Near 2,000 feet we observed the plane had banked past 30° and had continued turning past the assigned heading.
There was a slight descent, and the lowest we observed was about 1,850 feet, and received a terrain alert.
We took control of the aircraft, turned back to assigned heading and climbed back to 2,000 feet.
We were then cleared to 3,000 and reengaged the auto pilot.
It appeared that the auto pilot had disengaged without aural alert or visual red flashing 'AP' on the FMA (flight mode annunciator).
Task saturation played a factor as we were climbing, turning, and receiving new frequencies while entering IMC through 500 feet.
Suggestions: Continue procedure of Crew announcing FMA changes as they occur to enhance situational awareness.
Continue to closely monitor desired versus actual flight path while using automation.
Departed runway XX assigned a left turn heading 050.
On departure engaged the autopilot at 700 feet AGL and initiated a left turn climbing to 2,000 feet.
Shortly after was given a frequency change and told to contact departure.
After checking in with departure noticed a slightly steeper than normal bank and a slow descent and saw the autopilot was no longer engaged.
I immediately took control of the aircraft and leveled the wings and initiated a climb towards 2,000.
At the same time we started climbing the terrain alert sounded, during the climb we went above 2,000 and were told to continue climbing to 3,000.
Suggestions: In the future will be more vigilant on monitoring the FMA (flight mode annunciator) and not get distracted during times of higher workload so as to know without a doubt what the current condition of the aircraft and autopilot are.
Embraer 505 air taxi crew reported a loss of aircraft control during the climb in instrument conditions, where the autopilot failed to remain engaged and was not noticed by the crew, resulting in a descent and a terrain warning.
The Captain took the flight controls and recovered the aircraft.
I am genuinely concerned about what I saw last night.
I looked out my window first and saw a very strange light that was NOT moving fast.
I have lived by the airport for 7 years now and I have NEVER seen anything like this before.
I went outside to investigate, thought it was a plane, but then I saw a plane traveling through and that's when I knew what I was seeing was not normal.
As I continued watching, I ended up seeing more in the sky, not too spread apart, I could also tell that a few of them were pretty big in size tell they were big ones and their lights (several of them) were noticeable and conveniently turning off or getting behind a cloud for a minute, only to reappear again, especially when I was taking more pictures.
But, the longer I stood outside the more I noticed less and less of them.
So I went inside for maybe three to four minutes, came back out, and there they were again, close to their same locations they held prior, and acting the exact same way again when I started taking a million pictures again and only two of those pictures came out, not real clear, which I thought was very weird.
When telling my neighbors, they thought there would be no reason for why they would be here in Idaho, but they are.
I saw at least 6-7 drones late last night over my house.
Flight XXXX, repositioning ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0, at approximately XA00, we encountered an elevator jam during the landing flare on Runway XXL at ZZZ.
I was serving as the Captain (CA) and pilot flying (PF) for this flight.
During the after-start checklist, the flight controls synoptic page indicated full elevator travel.
The takeoff proceeded without incident, and the autopilot was engaged as normal.
The flight was uneventful until the conclusion of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
While leveling off at 3,000 feet and subsequently at 2,000 feet, an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message was displayed, and the autopilot exhibited difficulty maintaining level flight.
In response, I disengaged the autopilot, manually trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the autopilot in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
Following a second occurrence of the issue, I opted to disengage the autopilot and conduct the approach manually.
During the landing flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, I observed that the control column was abnormally stiff and exhibited minimal movement when pulled.
Despite this, the aircraft touched down without further issues.
While taxiing to the gate, I instructed the First Officer (FO) to test his control column to assess the functionality of the controls and confirm findings on the Flight Control System (FCS) synoptic page.
The elevator appeared to move normally in the downward direction but achieved only approximately three-quarters of its full range in the upward direction.
Upon arriving at the gate and consulting with Maintenance, we were instructed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
This action confirmed that the FO's side of the elevator operated freely, while the Captain's side remained jammed.
A subsequent external inspection of the aircraft revealed no visible damage to the elevator or horizontal stabilizer.
Flight XXXX, repo flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.
On Day 0 at approximately XA00, we experienced an elevator jam in the flare at ZZZ Runway XXL.
I was the FO and pilot monitoring.
The elevator appeared to have full travel based on the flight controls synoptic page during the after start checklist and I did not notice any strange feel on the controls.
We took off and the autopilot was engaged normally.
Nothing eventful happened until the end of the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ.
When leveling off at 3,000 and then 2,000 there was an AP (Autopilot) TRIM IS NU caution message and the AP did a poor job of leveling off.
In the first case, the PF disengaged the AP, trimmed the aircraft, and reengaged the AP in accordance with the QRH.
After the second occurrence, the PF disengaged the AP and continued the approach hand flying.
In the flare, as the aircraft was about to touch down, he remarked that he had no control.
The aircraft touched down normally.
Once we had taxied clear of the runway, he asked me to feel the controls and confirm with the FCS (Flight Control System) page.
The elevator moved down normally but up only approximately 3/4 of the way.
After taxiing to the gate and calling Maintenance, we were directed to pull the PITCH DISC handle.
The FO side was free moving and the CA remained jammed.
An external inspection of the aircraft did not indicate any damage to the elevator or stabilizer.
CRJ550 flight crew reported they experienced an elevator jam while in the landing flare.
Flight ABCD ZZZ1 to ZZZ on Day 0 experienced a full hydraulic system 3 failure on final (CA flying).
Upon selection of gear down, several caution messages began to appear representing a hydraulic system failure.
We initiated a go around.
We were unable to retract the gear on the go around, receiving a Gear disagree warning.
With the ceilings at 3500’ and receiving icing in our descent we opted to remain out of icing with the gear extended and took radar vectors at 3,000’.
After completing the applicable QRH an evaluation was made based upon weather, terrain and fuel, that our best option was to land in ZZZ.
Cause: Hydraulic system 3 failure upon gear down.
Resulting in depletion of hydraulic system 3 fluid quantity.
CRJ900 Captain reported a hydraulic failure during the final approach resulting in a go-around.
On the arrival into BET Rnwy 1L we could not get the runway or approach lights to turn on.
The airport was uncontrolled and the CTAF 118.7.
We tried several times and were not able to get the lights on.
We went missed and returned to ZZZ.
ZZZ was not on the flight release as an alternate.
We assumed that when dispatch said "ok, come on back Aircraft X" that ZZZ was now an acceptable alternate.
When we landed in ZZZ, dispatch said that ZZZ was not an acceptable alternate, and asked why we didn't use ZZZ1 as the alternate.
We should have briefed the alternate when we briefed the approach, when we called dispatch telling them that we could not land in Bethel we should have confirmed with dispatch that the alternate was ZZZ1.
First Officer reported encountering inoperative approach lighting while on the arrival to BET airport in marginal VFR weather.
The crew performed a go around and returned to the departure airport.
About 50 miles from ZZZ airport on the way to ZZZ1 airport, the right engine began to drop in percent power and RPM sporadically.
The percent power dropped about 20% each time and the RPM would drop about 100 RPM.
I made the decision to air return to ZZZ airport.
Tecnam P2012 pilot reported the right engine dropped in power and RPM sporadically in flight.
Pilot returned to departure airport.
On takeoff for a standard training flight with a student the right main gear of the aircraft separated from the plane on rotation.
I felt a loud thud and looked to the side of the plane and thought I saw a tire rolling down the Runway.
I asked tower to verify our gear and they told us it was missing.
I requested to go to ZZZ to land there since they have a longer Runway and I knew id be sliding a great distance.
Got the weather from ZZZ1 Tower for ZZZ and they said it was broken at 1100.
Found a hole to go through and got under the layer.
Did a low approach to verify the right gear was the missing gear and came in to land after one circuit in the pattern.
Came to rest with no wingtip, prop or stabilizer damage.
No injuries.
PA28 Flight Instructor reported the right main gear separated from the aircraft on initial climb and they diverted to a nearby airport to land.
I was operating my drone alongside my friend from a boat about a half mile off the coast for recreational purposes.
We rented a boat with some friends to view the airshow from the water and he asked me to bring it to get some aerial shots of us on the boat.
It was a disappointing day for the air show because the cloud layer and fog was so low that airplanes weren't able to fly most of the day.
We noticed another drone flying off a boat next to us so we thought it would be fun to get a quick aerial picture of us while on the boat while no airplanes were flying.
We had a captain in charge of driving the boat for us and asked him if it would be okay to do so and he said yes, noting that they fly drones off the boat all the time.
My friend was flying it at the time and kept it well under the height of the mast and only about a 15 foot radius off the boat and at most 15 feet high above the water for a few minutes to get the shot.
We then noticed a lifeguard boat coming toward us and realized that it was most likely due to the drone so I took the controls from him and landed it immediately.
They asked who the owner of the drone was so I confessed it was mine and took responsibility for it then complied with their questions for personal information.
They told me that drones can't be flying in the area due to the air show and I obliged, apologizing for my negligence.
For some reason, maybe partly due to the poor weather, I sincerely did not think of the TFR being in affect extending over the ocean and down to the surface of the water where we were as it was my first time doing this sort of thing.
While no planes were flying at the time, I still realize now that this was a violation of the airspace and take full responsibility for my actions.
I am disappointed in myself for not thinking about the limitations surrounding the air show, immediately realizing I should have known better.
It was a lack of judgement on my part that I will ensure never happens again by reviewing all local airspace parameters for drones especially when there's an event in the area and abiding by all safety protocol before flying.
Recreational / Hobbyist UAS pilot reported flying their drone from a boat within a TFR area without authorization.
Reporter stated they were not aware the TFR extended over water.
On approximately 20 mile final approach to ZZZ XR, multiple failures occurred in the electrical system and the EICAS displayed several associated messages.
Crew discontinued ILS approach, [request priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors to troubleshoot the malfunctions and run appropriate QRH procedures.
Notable items were >DC BUS 2 OFF, >AVNX MAU 2A FAIL, >AVNX MAU 3B FAIL.
These 3 items caused approximately 30 system failures all correctly listed in the QRH and noted by flight crew.
Some highlights were loss of display unit 5, FMS 1, nose-wheel steering, some spoilers, RALT, HYD ELEC PUMPS 1 & 3B, Auto-throttles, #2 Reverser, and several other functions.
Please see the full list on pgs. X-A of QRH.
Additionally COM 2 & 3 failed (single radio now), which impacted flight crew ability to communicate with ATC, ZZZ1 OPS, DISPATCH, & TECH OPS.
We unsuccessfully attempted to use COM 3 voice to communicate with ZZZ1, and then it would not cycle back to data mode.
Ultimately we made the decision to request “off-frequency” with ATC for 4 minutes on a vector so we could inform ZZZ Ops & tech ops of our [priority handling] situation.
At this point, the 19 additional related EICAS messages were also evaluated and crew agreed they were likely caused by the 3 previously noted >Items.
We chose to take the most restrictive instructions from multiple QRH procedures and perform a non-normal approach IAW DC BUS 2 OFF p. X-A.
The fuel state was nearing 5000 lbs and we were still clean configuration at 6000’ above a 4500’ broken layer.
CA wanted to ensure gear and flap extension below the cloud layer with contingency fuel for further unexpected failures or a go-around.
It became a decision point to commence the approach based on the information we had at that time including verification of ILS signal and VMC weather below the broken layer.
Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.
Receive clear instructions for turns from ATC.
For example: Turn RIGHT heading XXX or Turn LEFT Heading YYY.
Use of words should as negative turn are harder to decipher and I thought it meant immediate turn.
In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
When load increases in the cockpit, do not disconnect the A/P and leverage automation to reduce pilot workload.
General aviation pilot reported miscommunication with ATC after receiving an altitude and heading assignment on an IFR departure.
The communication issues resulted in an altitude deviation and altitude alert warning from ATC, then the pilot returned to the cleared course.
To improve safety, I recommend considering the use of an Initial Approach Fix for clearance to the LOC DME E approach in IMC.
This might help reduce pilot workload and minimize the risk of deviations in a challenging approach like ASE.
I'm committed to safe flying practices and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1.
The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft.
We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains.
As we were just starting to make it into the mountains, our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it.
Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off.
The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal.
After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting, the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away.
By this time, the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region.
We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7,500ft while we were outside of the clouds.
A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip.
We asked center if they had any precip on radar, and they advised that they could not see any where we were at.
Due to deteriorating conditions, we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us.
This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it.

Upon completion of multiple QRH procedures, CA called the inflight crew to provide situation brief and assign precautionary code.
The normal cabin call button did not function properly so CA utilized [priority handling] call button to communicate with inflight.
CA explained the situational need to use [priority handling] CALL since it likely generated a startle factor to them.
Plus we had already [requested priority handling] with ATC so the [priority handling] call was appropriate anyway.
CA also made PA announcement to customers explaining the reason for the inflight delay to troubleshoot the EICAS messages and to inform them that the aircraft would need to be towed to the gate upon landing since one of the failed systems was nose wheel steering.
Crew conducted ILS XR approach using non-normal landing data required by QRH.
After landing, CA taxied clear of runway using differential braking & thrust as prescribed in QRH.
Once clear, crew coordinated with ZZZ OPS for a tow-in the rest of the way to gate.
CA made PA to update the customers on the status of tow-in to gate.
Normal deplaning conducted when parked at gate.
Logbook entry of corrective maintenance action to replace TRU 2.
E-190 pilot reported electrical system failures resulting in numerous system malfunctions while on approach to land.
Crew landed after performing checklist procedures.
Situation: Altitude deviation on IFR departure due to task saturation induced by miscommunication.
On an IFR departure, I was assigned an altitude to climb to (2100 MSL) and a heading (120) to maintain until given radar vectors to the next fix (a VOR) by ATC.
After being handed off departure from tower, I checked in with ATC with the tail number, my current altitude and informed them that I was climbing.
To keep the radio call short I did not state which altitude I was climbing to as that was part of the previous clearance.
My first radio call was missed by ATC.
Later, ATC called with "XXX are you up?"
I answered immediately with the tail number XXX, my altitude (now higher than on previous call) and that I was climbing.
I was then informed of "radar contact", an altimeter setting and "verify you're assigned altitude."
What I did hear was "verify your altitude."
This seemed strange to me as I was still climbing to the altitude I was given.
I communicated my new altitude on ATC.
I started to wonder if there is something wrong with my altitude.
ATC came back with 'altitude should be 2100'.
I then confirmed, XXX is climbing to 2100.
Quite some time has now elapsed since my first radio call and the confirmation to climb to 2100, which was already part of my clearance.
At this point I just finished turning to the initial clearance heading of 120.
The next communication I heard was ''negative turn, you should be turning on course'.
I did not understand if I heard negative turn as it's a terminology I had not heard before and I was already on a 120 heading course for sometime.
Did this mean turn back? turn the opposite direction?
I assumed it meant 'immediate turn, you should be turning on course'.
I complied, turning immediately to my next point, direct ZZZ VOR, which is a left turn and also complying with the opposite direction.
I was surprised by the confusion in the turn and the urgency to make a turn in the opposite direction before reaching 2100.
I assumed this was due to the very long time elapsed in the previous communication calls and that the instruction to turn was not communicated to me yet.
To accelerate the immediate turn request, I disconnected the A/P, which was on a 120 heading, and made a sharp left turn.
Inadvertently I lost altitude in the process.
Confused, while in the turn I told ATC "Aircraft X is turning to ZZZ, do you want me to change?"
I heard back from ATC no information about the turn, but rather 'altitude alert, climb to 2100'.
This is when I realized that I lost some altitude during the turn, I then climbed continuing direct to ZZZ as there was no heading correction, and later was given next vectors out of the area.
There was never any call out about the heading change to the ZZZ VOR, which confirmed me that I properly complied to that instruction.
There was miscommunication on both sides.
The controller may have not been hearing me properly and was trying to get me to climb to 2100.
With my utmost desire to comply, I perceived an unusual sense of urgency specifically for the turn to my next fix and not as much for the climb (immediate versus expedite instructions).
I started to turn direct to it without vectors and asked for verification.
This contributed to task overload close to the ground and I lost some of my altitude of climb, which was then rectified as soon as I saw it.
The total length of this event, which was about a minute on the radio while close to the ground certainly increased the risk.
This situation can be improved by: 1. ATC to use a more concise language.
This would reduce the communication time and, enable me to better focus and execute the request.
For example: instead of asking me to 'verify assigned' altitude, I could be told just "climb to 2100" from the first try.
Using the language "climb IMMEDIATELY to 2100" would have helped me realize the urgency for me to climb to 2100 from my previously assigned altitude by the airport tower instead of 'expedite' in subsequent calls.
It would have not taken us over 30 seconds to be on the same page.

In hindsight I should have verified the turn request before starting the turn.
This would have helped me avoid task saturation leading to involuntary altitude loss
and would have achieved the altitude request faster versus introducing a new variable in the flight (a turn).
